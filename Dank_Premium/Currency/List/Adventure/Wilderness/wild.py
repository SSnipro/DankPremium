You are exploring the wilderness when three paths lay beyond you. On the right, you see a lot of animals and luckily enough, you brought your hunting rifle.
On the left is a cliff. Down the cliff, there are some really mysterious plants. 
In front is a path. Something is telling you that you should follow it. What do you want to do?
    
/PDHunt - Hunt the animals!
/PDCliff - Try to get down the cliff and examine the mysterious plants!
/PDFollowPath - Go straight forward!
